All the source code of "Java for Aliens", first edition (updated to Java 13) by Claudio De Sio Cesari.

These folders contain all the book source code divided by chapters. For each folder related to a chapter you will find two sub-folders: "examples" and "exercises".
In the "examples" folder you will find all the code examples that you can find in the pages of the book, placed in subfolders that identify the section they belong to.
In the "exercises" folder you will find all the code (traces and solutions) of the exercises related to the chapter in question.
All files have been tested to work from the command line or with EJE (https://sourceforge.net/projects/eje/). Where the sources are declared to belong to packages, they will always be placed in the root folder. If you want to use them in IDEs like Eclipse and Netbeans, these tools will help you to place the various files in the right folders.

Happy coding!
